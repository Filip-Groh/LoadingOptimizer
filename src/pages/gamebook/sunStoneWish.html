    <p>
        The sprites exchange mischievous glances. "The Sunstone," the largest one replies, "is guarded by the Whispering Trees."
    </p>
    <p>
        "The Whispering Trees?" you ask, confused.
    </p>
    <p>
        "They stand at the heart of the woods," the sprite explains. "They whisper secrets, but only to those who are worthy."
    </p>
    <p>
        The sprites then vanish into the undergrowth, leaving you alone with the knowledge of the Sunstone's location. You continue deeper into the woods, the Whispering Trees now your ultimate goal.
