    <p>
        The sprites seem surprised by your gesture. They hesitate for a moment, then cautiously approach you. One of them, bolder than the others, takes a berry from your hand and pops it into its mouth. A delighted squeal erupts from the swarm. The sprites begin to dance around you, their laughter filling the air.

        Suddenly, the largest sprite steps forward. "You have a kind heart," it chirps. "As a reward, we will grant you a single wish."
