    <h1>Gamebook - Follow map</h1>
    <p>
        The narrow path winds through a thicket of thorny bushes, scratching at your clothes and skin. You push through, determined to reach your destination. Suddenly, the path forks. To your left, a small, moss-covered statue of a mischievous-looking sprite beckons you forward. To your right, a path leads towards a shimmering pool of water.
