        <h1>Gamebook - Starting location</h1>
        <p>The flickering torchlight casts long, dancing shadows as you venture deeper into the Whispering Woods. An eerie silence hangs heavy in the air, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves and the distant hooting of an owl. You shiver, not just from the cold night air, but from a creeping sense of unease.

            You are on a quest to find the legendary Sunstone, a gem said to hold immense power. Local villagers claim it was stolen by the mischievous sprites who dwell deep within these woods. They warn of treacherous paths, mischievous creatures, and perilous trials that await those who dare to enter.

            But you are no ordinary adventurer. You possess a map, ancient and worn, leading you towards the heart of the woods. It promises riches beyond imagination, but also whispers of danger.
